              Caravaggio, whose work Rubens had seen in Italy. This style is characterised by its
              exciting effects of light and unpolished naturalism.
              Rubens did not make this painting to be sold; instead he retained possession of it.
              He probably used it as study material for the pupils in his studio.'
